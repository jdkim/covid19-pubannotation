# Covid19-PubAnnotation

***An open collaboration for annotating literature of Covid-19***

Since the LitCovid (by NCBI) and the CORD-19 (by Allen Institute for AI) datasets were released, many groups are producing and releasing annotations to the data set. Covid19-PubAnnotation is an open collaboration to collect those effort and produce an integrated annotation to the Covid-19-related literature datasets. PubAnnotation is an open repository of literature annotation which features functionalities to collect and integrate contributed annotations. A collaborative annotation environment for the two literature datasets are setup at PubAnnotation, and a number of groups area producing annotation for contribution. We are aiming at releasing a meaning amount of rich annotation data sets in the end of the virtual hackathon. Contribution with annotation datasets is completely open, and all the contributed annotation datasets will become immediately integrated and accessible, in various ways, including search, visualization, and fine-grained access.
